Project Description: Knight's Tour Game

The Knight's Tour Game is a recreational project that brings the classical problem of the "Knight's Tour" to life in an interactive and engaging
way. The Knight's Tour is a puzzle that challenges players to find a sequence of moves for a knight on a chessboard such that the knight visits 
each square exactly once.

The objective of this project is to develop a game that allows players to explore and solve the Knight's Tour problem on a virtual chessboard.
Players will have the opportunity to control the knight's movements and strategize their way through the board, aiming to complete a successful
tour.

To play the game simply download Knights Tour.exe and run the file. You will need a Java runtime Environment to run this game.
